    <h2><i>Beginning programmer</i></h2>

    <p>I work at biotechnology company name SOTIO, which is company developing new therapies focusing on the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases, as a lab technician. It sounds like an interesting job, but after six years of working here, I can say that it's not really true. <br> That's one of the reasons why I started learning programming to change my job.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I either learn to program or help fan groups translate games. Which may sound a bit strange because my spoken English is very bad.</p>
