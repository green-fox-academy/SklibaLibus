When I think that I don't know that and
I think I don't think about that.
Please write a function that takes two parameters!
       the first "parameter" is a string that represents the name of a file;
       the function should read the file and count each of the words inside the file;
       the second parameter is a string that represents the name of a file;
       the function should write all the words and its count (separated with spaces) as new lines in the file in descending order, based on the count
       You should handle the exceptions?
